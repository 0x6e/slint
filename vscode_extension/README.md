# sixtyfps-vscode README

Extension for VSCode which include syntax coloration and a way to start the LSP server

## How to run the LSP

At the moment you need to load this directory in VS code and then start debugging (Run -> Start Debugging). That will "debug" the vs code extension and create a new VS code window. The LSP server binary will be started if previously built. You can see the output in the output pane "SixtyFPS LSP" (that's the drop-down that usually shows "Tasks").
