This example is a clone of https://github.com/peter-ha/qskinny/tree/iot-dashboard/examples/iot-dashboard

The images are originating from that repository

The main.60 and iot-dashboard.60 files are basically a pure translation from
the C++ QSkinny code to self-contained .60.

The Example was also extended with .cpp code to show how to use the C++
interpreter to dynamically generate .60 files on the fly and to show different
widgets and their backend, forwarding all the properties from widgets to the
root so they can be changed by the backends.
