# Creating The Tiles From Rust

The tiles in the game should have a random placement. We'll need to add the <`rand` dependency to
`Cargo.toml` for the randomization.

```toml
[dependencies]
sixtyfps = "0.0.6"
rand = "0.8" # Added
```

What we'll do is take the list of tiles declared in the .60 language, duplicate it, and shuffle it.
We'll do so by accessing the `memory_tiles` property through the Rust code. For each top-level property,
a getter and a setter function is generated - in our case `get_memory_tiles` and `set_memory_tiles`.
Since `memory_tiles` is an array in the `.60` language, it is represented as a [`Rc<dyn sixtyfps::Model>`](https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/trait.model).
We can't modify the model generated by the .60, but we can extract the tiles from it, and put it
in a [`VecModel`](https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/struct.vecmodel) which implements the `Model` trait.
`VecModel` allows us to make modifications and we can use it to replace the static generated model.

We modify the main function like so:

```rust
fn main() {
    use sixtyfps::Model;

    let main_window = MainWindow::new();

    // Fetch the tiles from the model
    let mut tiles: Vec&lt;TileData> =
        main_window.get_memory_tiles().iter().collect();
    // Duplicate them to ensure that we have pairs
    tiles.extend(tiles.clone());

    // Randomly mix the tiles
    use rand::seq::SliceRandom;
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
    tiles.shuffle(&amp;mut rng);

    // Assign the shuffled Vec to the model property
    let tiles_model =
        std::rc::Rc::new(sixtyfps::VecModel::from(tiles));
    main_window.set_memory_tiles(
        sixtyfps::ModelHandle::new(tiles_model.clone()));

    main_window.run();
}
```

Note that we clone the `tiles_model` because we'll use it later to update the game logic.

Running this gives us a window on the screen that now shows a 4 by 4 grid of rectangles, which can show or obscure
the icons when clicking. There's only one last aspect missing now, the rules for the game.
