# Slint-python (Alpha)

[Slint](https://slint.dev/) is a UI toolkit that supports different programming languages.
Slint-python is the integration with Python.

**Warning: Alpha**
Slint-python is still in the very early stages of development: APIs will change and important features are still being developed,
the project is overall incomplete.

You can track the overall progress for the Python integration in GitHub at https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/milestone/18
as well as by looking at python-labelled issues at https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/labels/a%3Alanguage-python .

If you want to just play with this, you can try running our Python port of the [printer demo](../../examples/printerdemo/python/README.md):

```bash
cd examples/printerdemo/python
pipenv update
pipenv run python main.py
```
